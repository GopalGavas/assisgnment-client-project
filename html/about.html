            <h2>About Us...</h2>
          <p>
            Mangata and Gallo is a jewelry store that specializes in special
            occasions like engagements, weddings and anniversaries. The jewelry
            company primarily operates online and has a small storefront in
            Austin, Texas with an atelier attached for browsing. Mangata &
            Gallo's selection of jewelry is known for its high-quality and
            classic look. The owner, an Austin local, is well known for her
            jewelry designs.<br /><br />
            Mariana is the owner and the lead designer of Mangata and Gallo.
            After graduating from design school with a specialization in diamond
            cutting and metal smithing, Mariana opened a store in her hometown,
            Austin and started to grow her business online. Mariana has always
            managed every aspect of the business, from jewelry design to
            marketing to e-commerce. However, she recently hired several
            artisans to help craft her designs and a young employee to help
            manage the company website and social media accounts.
